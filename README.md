> [!CAUTION]
> **This software is in VERY, and I really mean VERY early stage of development!** It still doesn't have the most basic features and could even not work at all. It is basically unusable for now, because there isn't even what to use at this stage.

> [!WARNING]
> **Be prepared for a firestorm!** I ([krystejj](https://github.com/krystejj)) am still learning to code in Rust. That means there can be major and really basic bugs in my code. While I am expanding my experience with Rust and learning new things, be aware that you may find even most basic mistakes here. You can always create a pull request or issue in this repo when you find or encounter any error, all help is always appreciated.

**Klark** is a free, modern and open-source media server and collection manager, created for **The Klark Project**. It hosts an API which frontends can use, it also can host such a web frontend. **The Klark Project** allows you to easily watch your collected movies, tv series or photos, listen to your music and read your ebooks, manage them, search and download new by BitTorrent, and all of this using your favorite frontend. Currently only one frontend is in development, that is the [Klark Svelte Frontend](https://github.com/krystejj/klark-svelte-frontend), which is a stunning web frontend written in [the Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/). **Klark** is amazingly fast and stable because of usage of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Actix web framework](https://actix.rs/). This project aims to be a perfect alternative to [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Emby](https://emby.media/) and [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/). Support for Jellyfin (and maybe more media servers) protocol is planned, which would allow Jellyfin frontends to work with Klark.

## üôè Used Projects and Credits
This is a list of projects used in development of this frontend:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - an incredibly fast and reliable programming language that guarantees memory and thread safety,
- [Actix](https://actix.rs/) - a powerful and extremely fast web framework for Rust.

üíó Big thanks to the creators and all contributors of these projects.
