> [!CAUTION]
> **This software is in VERY, and I really mean VERY early stage of development!** It still doesn't have the most basic features and could even not work at all. It is basically unusable for now, because there isn't even what to use at this stage.

> [!WARNING]
> **Be prepared for a firestorm!** I ([krystejj](https://github.com/krystejj)) am still learning to code in Rust. That means there can be major and really basic bugs in my code. While I am expanding my experience with Rust and learning new things, be aware that you may find even most basic mistakes here. You can always create a pull request or issue in this repo when you find or encounter any error, all help is always appreciated.

**Klark** is a free, modern and open-source media server and collection manager, as a part of **The Klark Project**. It hosts an API which frontends can use, it also can host a web frontend if you like. Klark allows you to easily watch your collected movies, tv series or photos, listen to your music and read your ebooks, manage them, search and download new using BitTorrent, and all of this from any device you want through the client. Klark also aims to be very fast, performant and easy to use.

## üíª Clients / Frontends
Currently only one main client is in development, that is the [Klark Svelte Frontend](https://github.com/krystejj/klark-svelte-frontend). However, other clients like Android or Apple TV apps are also planned, but web frontend is one with highest priority for now because of very early stage of development. You can create a new client on your own if you like.

There are also plans for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) protocol support. That means you could use any Jellyfin client like [Jellyfin Android](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-android) or [Swiftfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/swiftfin) with your Klark server. Other protocols might be supported too.

In development:
- [Klark Svelte Frontend](https://github.com/krystejj/klark-svelte-frontend) - web, main
